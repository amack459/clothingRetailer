# Shop Til You Drop


This is a mock clothing retailer site built with Angular and Bootstrap. The JS directory consists of a controller and service. The cart is a service so that if it was added to a bigger build, would be accessible throughout the website/app. Items added to the cart are stored in localStorage so that the items remain if the page is refreshed. You're able to view the changes made to the cart in the top righthand corner. Unfortunately, I broke the functionality for changing quantity, and loss the working code. Time didn't allow for it to be rebuilt. So, I've commented what I would have done. As a result of this hiccup, I didn't get to implement the validation for footwear using a REGEX as planned, but I've also commented that code in the mainController.js. I've only focused on responsiveness for Apple and moving from desktop to ipad.
