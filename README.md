# Shop Til You Drop


This is a mock clothing retailer site built with Angular and Bootstrap. Right click index.html file in text editor and open in browser to run locally. I used Bower to install Angular and Bootstrap. So, if there's a problem getting everything connected (after you right click on the index.html to open in brower): 
  1. Go to the terminal 
  2. `bower init` 
  3. `bower install angular` 
  4. `bower install bootstrap`
  5. Up to you but I delete the JQuery directory that comes with Bootstrap since it can interfere with the JQuery Lite used in Angular.
